.. note::

    The `dtype` (data type) field for any parameter can be set according to 
    https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.dtypes.html. The type specified
    must be supported by the generator.

    By default, the `dtype` value is ``None``, which means the variable is a scalar
    with a type determined by the generator.
